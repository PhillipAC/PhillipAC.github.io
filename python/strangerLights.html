        <p>
			Stranger Lights is what I gave the name of my halloween door. The materials 
			I used to create it using a cardboard box, foil, Maki Maki, Raspberry Pi, 
			Arduino Nano, and an addressable LED ribbon.
		</p>

		<h3>The Pressure Plate:</h3>
		<p>
			To create a pressure plate, which is hidden under a door mat. I took a cardboard 
			box and cut it into two square pieces. On the bottom of each piece I glued a sheet 
			of aluminum foil. I then placed the two pieces together with the foil side facing 
			inward with some additional cardboard to create a gap so the foil would not touch at rest. 
			One sheet of foil was connected to the ground terminal of the Maki Maki while the other one 
			is wired to the space button. When the Maki Maki detects that the circuit has been completed 
			(by the foil sheets touching) it sends a space signal to the Raspberry Pi.
		</p>

		<h3>Raspberry Pi:</h3>
		<p>
			The Raspberry Pi controls when the light show will play as well as provides the audio. 
			The application cycles through a list of songs and waits for the space button to be pressed. 
			Once the space button is pressed it stops the current song and begins playing the theme music 
			to Stranger Things. At this time it also sends a signal to the Arduino that it is time to start 
			the light show. While the light show is playing the Raspberry Pi ignores any 
			additional space button presses. 
		</p>

		<h3>Arduino:</h3>
		<p>
			The LEDs that I use could not be controlled straight from the Raspberry Pi so I used an Arduino 
			to interface with the ribbon. When the Arduino is not playing through the light show it alternates 
			orange and green lights. However, when a signal over the usb port is detected the Arduino begins 
			the light show. The instructions the Arduino sends to the LED ribbon and the music that the 
			Raspberry Pi plays are synced up. Once the show is over the Arduino returns to its waiting stage
		</p>

		<h3>Final Product:</h3>

		<p>
			It is so fun to see the trick or treaters walk up to the house. I generally get an audible gasp when 
			they walk across the pressure plate and are welcomed with a short little show. I look forward to adding 
			more in the future.
