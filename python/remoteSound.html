        <p>
			The idea behind the Remote Sound project was to have a device
			setup to play music for my son to help him go to sleep when 
			he moved into his own room. The original idea was simple 
			hit a button, play music. Around the time I began this 
			project Amazon had a discount on their Dash buttons and 
			I began wondering if I could use the devices with my project 
			to create a remote button. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After a little research I learned that the Dash buttons 
			would turn on and connect to the local network and then 
			send a request to the amazon servers when the button was 
			pressed and then turn off. I decided to write a program 
			to sniff my local network and detect when the amazon 
			button connected at which point the program would start, 
			or stop, playing music. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually I also decided that I would provide the ability 
			to hardwire a button to the Raspberry Pi just in case the 
			remote was lost or we were just in the room.
