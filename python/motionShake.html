        <p>
			The idea behind the Motion Shake project was to create a device
			that would shake a fake cage when someone walks in front of it.
			To accomplish this idea I decided to use a PIR sensor to detect
			the motion and two vibration motors to shake the cage with an 
			Arduino to tie everything together. The cage 
			itself was a small do it yourself project. It was created by 
			using two laundry baskets facing eachother and spray painted gray.
			I put a small pumpkin headed creature inside of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The program itself is very simple. It waits for a HIGH signal from
			the PIR sensor at which point it will loop 6 times. Since the
			motors are attached to digital pins on an Arduino I use the modulo
			operation to determine which pin to set to HIGH and then after a second
			turn back to LOW. As such it will cycle through however many motors
			that are attached. Afterwards it waits for five seconds before attempting
			to detect motion.
