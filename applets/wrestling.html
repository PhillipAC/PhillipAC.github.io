        This is a purly fun game I made to bring to a wrestling party. 
        I set the game up with a <a href = "http://makeymakey.com/">
        Makey Makey</a> to make it so my friends have to use their
        full bodies to compete.
        <br>
        Gameplay is simple. Player 1 uses WASD and Player 2 uses the
        arrow keys.
        <ul>
            <li>LEFT/RIGHT: LEFT/RIGHT or A/D</li>
            <li>Reach: UP or W</li>
            <li>Duck: DOWN or S</li>
        </ul>
        The objective of the game is to exhaust the other player.
        Reaching for someone will exhaust you but if you can grab
        the other player press the reach button over and over to cause
        them exhaustion. If you are grabbed you will need to press 
        reach over and over to break free. Every so often a chair
        might appear. Walk over to it to throw the chair. If a chair
        is coming for you you can press duck to escape. You can also
        duck to rest, but while ducking you cannot reach for the other
        player leaving you open to being grabbed.
