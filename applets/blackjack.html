    <p id = "Notes">
        This game is very simple. Play against the dealer as cards are
        dealt. Press hit to get a new card and hold when you are done.
        Try to get at close to 21 without going over as possible. <br>
        This game was designed to show my students how cards can be 
        objects and a deck is a special object that has an array
        that holds the car objects. The card and deck objects were
        designed so that they could be used in different games. This
        is one such game that could be made with them.
