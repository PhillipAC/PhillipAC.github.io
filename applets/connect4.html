        Compete against a friend to get 6 squares of your color 
        in a row or diagonal. You take turns dropping squares.

        This game was made to show of grid based gameplay. In addition
        the gameboard can be any size with any number of rows and columns. 
        This creates a very customizable gameboard by just adjusted a few
        numbers in declearing the board. You can even have more than one
        board running at a time.
