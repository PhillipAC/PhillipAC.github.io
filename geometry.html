            I made this applet as a demonstration of the four different
            transformations that we cover in Geometry. You can press
            the buttons to move between demonstrations. In addition
            you can press left/right up/down to change around the 
            magnitude of various transformations.
            <br>
            This applet was design to be able to make more than just
             transformations happen. You can create polygon objects
             with an array of points and create new polygons using
             various transformations. So far there are 3 made types
             of objects:
             <ul>
                 <li>Points</li>
                 <li>Lines</li>
                 <li>Polygons</li>
             </ul>
        </p>
