            This game is a clone of Minesweeper. Left click to uncover 
            squares and right click to flag as a mine. Try to uncover
            all the squares that do not have mines. The number  on an
            uncovered square tells you how many squares around that square
            that have mines.

            This game was designed after a student said that my Conway's 
            Game of Life game reminded him of Minesweeper. I used most
            of my Game of Life code to create this game to help show
            how you can reuse code in various ways.
