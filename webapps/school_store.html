        The School Coffee Shop web app is a solution to pen and paper 
        ordering system that interrupted instructional time. The app 
        lets the admin create items to sell while providing workers 
        at the shop the ability to filter orders based on teacher, 
        period, day, and costumer. The app uses Google for 
        authentication allowing a school to limit users to specific 
        google education domains. While the focus was a building a 
        coffee shop the app can be edited very easily to accommodate 
        any school shop that takes orders. The Git respository for 
        this web app 
        can be found at <a href="https://github.com/PhillipAC/schoolshop">
