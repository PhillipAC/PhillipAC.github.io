        A Scavenger QR Hunt is a twist on the traditional Scavenger Hunt.
        Instead of searching for specific items the goal is to search 
        for locations. Traditionally the locations are solutions to puzzles
        or riddles; however, locations can also be given as a sort of "race."
        Players search out QR codes that are placed in at the locations.
        After scanning the QR codes users select their team to claim the
        location. The player who is running the scavenger can then view
        what locations the teams have claimed and all the teams that have
        claimed specific locations. The Git respository for this web app 
        can be found at <a href="https://github.com/PhillipAC/scavanger_hunt">
