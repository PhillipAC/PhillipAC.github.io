        My name is Phillip Clontz and I am a software engineer
        working for Northrop Grumman in Huntsville, Alabama. 
        Outside of work I spend my time raising my wonderful son
        Benjamin with my wife Christina. In addition, I still work 
        on pet projects that I will add pages for.

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        I was born and raised in Huntsville, Alabama. I attended
        high school at Madison County's Buckhorn High School where I gained my
        first real experience with programming in an intro to C++ 
        class. During my high school years, I played around with
        several different languages C++, Java, and BASIC. I also
        worked on making several games using GameMaker and RPGMaker.<br>
        After graduating from high school, I attended the University of
        Alabama in Huntsville where I majored in Mathematics. While at
        UAH I also took the education curriculum to become a secondary teacher.
        During this time I grew my knowledge of programming by taking
        a couple of programming classes. After college I taught Calculus for 
        three years before switching professions to focus on programming.<br><br>
        I began my first job as a software engineer working on a ASP.NET MVC
        web app at SAIC. After a year and a half I moved to a related ASP.NET 
        WPF application where I helped design a large modular. Since moving to
        Northrop Grumman I have been developing in LabVIEW.
