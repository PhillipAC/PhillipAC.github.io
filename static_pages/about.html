        My name is Phillip Clontz and I am a math teacher at
        New Hope high School. I currently teach a range of 
        courses including Geometry, Algebra 2, Pre-Calculus,
        and AP Calculus.<br><br>
        In addition to core classes, I teach programming as
        an elective course. In this class I use Khan Academy's
        programming course to structure the class. This
        course teaches students how to program using 
        processingJS to interact with the HTML5 Canvas.<br><br>
        Outside of classes I also coach the New Hope Scholars Bowl
        Team. Information about Scholars Bowl can be found at 
        <a href="http://madisoncountyscholarsbowl.weebly.com/">
            Madison County's Scholars Bowl Website</a>.

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        I was born and raised in Huntsville, Alabama. I attended
        high school at Madison County's Buckhorn High School where I gained my
        first real experience with programming in an intro to C++ 
        class. During my high school years, I played around with
        several different languages C++, Java, and BASIC. I also
        worked on making several games using GameMaker and RPGMaker.<br>
        After graduating from high school, I attended the University of
        Alabama in Huntsville where I majored in Mathematics. While at
        UAH I also took the education curriculumn to become a secondary teacher.
        During this time I grew my knowledge of programming by taking
        a couple of programming classes.
